<p>
    Basilisk is a static website generator that builds HTML websites from a
    set of static files in multiple formats, such as HTML, markdown or plain
    text. It is designed in a modular way which makes it easily extensible.
</p>

<p>
    Nearly all core functionality of the program is provided in the form of
    swappable and replaceable modules which means that it can easily use
    different template systems, support many different input file formats or
    extend the existing functionality by implementing additional features such
    as blog systems or other mechanisms used for serving specific types of
    content.
</p>

<p>
    The program comes with multiple built-in modules implementing various
    functionalities like using fast and powerful Jinja2 templates, converting
    UNIX manual files or prettifying urls.
