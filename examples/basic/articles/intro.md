# LOTR intro
It all began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves;
immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven, to the Dwarf Lords, great
miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to
the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was
bound the strength and the will to govern over each race. But they were all of
them deceived, for another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of
Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret, a master ring, to control all
others. And into this ring he poured all his cruelty, his malice and his will to
dominate all life.
